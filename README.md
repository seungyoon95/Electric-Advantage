# Electric Advantage

Electric Advantage was a full-stack project created by five developers for a local startup that wanted a website to promote electric vehicles and have dealerships to post their inventory. Dealers would first request dealer privileges to the administrators (our client) and will get access to create a listing upon approval. Customers would then be able to search for a vehicle based on their preferences (price, location, model, etc), and contact the dealer once they find an appropriate vehicle for themselves. This website would act as a hub where multiple dealers could have their listings posted, similar to Autotrader or CarGurus but with electric vehicles only.
